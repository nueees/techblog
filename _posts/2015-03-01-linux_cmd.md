# 1. Linux Command Line

## 01_01 - [File system structure](https://www.makeuseof.com/linux-directory-structure-explained/)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83441376/179395333-47a10b33-62c4-464c-967f-0262821ce2ab.png)

### /boot
The boot directory contains important files needed by the [boot loader](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-bootloader/). 

### /dev
The /dev directory contains special, virtual files representing hardware components like a mouse, keyboard, storage devices, etc., connected to your system.

### /etc
The /etc directory contains vital system configuration files such as startup scripts, networking files, user account-related files, etc.

### /bin
The /bin directory contains system commands and other executable programs. The ls command that you use to list out the subdirectories along with many other useful commands is located within the /bin directory.

### /opt
The /opt directory contains optional software packages to facilitate better compatibility of certain applications. When you install a third-party application that is not available in the official distribution repository, its software code gets stored in the /opt directory.

### /proc
The /proc directory is a pseudo-filesystem containing information about processes and kernel parameters. It is populated with data during boot-up and is cleaned when you shut down your Linux machine.
The /proc directory is also home to system information such as memory usage, processor information, and so on.

### /usr
The /usr directory contains most of the files, libraries, programs, and system utilities. The /bin folder is symbolically linked to /usr/bin. The same goes for the /sbin and /lib directories.

### /var
The /var directory is the storage space for system-generated variable files, and it includes logs, caches, and spool files. The data in /var isn't automatically deleted, so sysadmins can collect and investigate system logs if need be.

### /media
When you connect any removable media device such as a USB thumb drive, CD, or DVD, Linux creates a subdirectory under /media where the contents of the device are laid out. This is usually done automatically by the system as soon as you plug the device in. When you remove the device, the system deletes the corresponding subdirectory.

### /mnt
The /mnt directory is used to mount storage devices in the system temporarily. However, some Linux distributions also use /mnt as a permanent storage solution. Unlike /media, the storage device isn't automatically mounted at /mnt by the system. Sysadmins have to manually mount a storage device and populate the file system table accordingly.

### /lib
A library is a collection of pre-compiled code that executable binaries can use. In Linux, the /lib directory serves as the storage space for all libraries needed by the binaries in the /bin directory.

### /sys
The /sys directory contains information about the various system components and drivers. It's akin to /proc but structured differently. Sysadmins use /proc and /sys inter-changeably to collect data.

### /run
The /run directory logs system information since boot time. You can find information about the daemons that are running, logged-in users, and more. The data stored in the /run directory can give you an idea of how the system resources are being utilized since startup.

## 02_04 - Finding help for commands

```
man ls

ls --help

apropos list
```


## 03_01 - The Linux file system

```
ls -l

file Documents

stat Documents

```

## 03_07 - Find files and Xargs
xargs: command line에 표준 입력을 인수로 제공.

```
find . -name "do*"

echo "file1 file2 file3" | xargs touch 
ls
> file1  file2  file3
# touch file1 file2 file3 하는 것과 같음

# 실행 전에 터미널에 명령을 인쇄하려면 -t(--verbose) 옵션
echo "file1 file2 file3" | xargs -t touch 

# 실행 전에 여부를 묻는 메시지를 표시하려면 -p(--interactive) 옵션
echo  "file1 file2 file3" | xargs -p touch
> touch file1 
> touch file2
> touch file3

# 지정된 명령에 전달할 인수 수를 지정하려면 -n(--max-args) 옵션
echo  "file1 file2 file3" |  xargs -n 1 -t touch

# 여러 명령을 실행하려면 -I(--replace) 옵션 (대체문자열: %)
find . -name "file*" -print0 | xargs -t -I % sh -c '{ ls -l %; }'
> -rwxrwxrwx 1 nueees nueees 0 Jul 17 13:49 file1
> -rwxrwxrwx 1 nueees nueees 0 Jul 17 13:49 file2
> -rwxrwxrwx 1 nueees nueees 0 Jul 17 13:49 file3

```


## 03_08 - Understand user roles and sudo

```
ls /root # 비번쳐야 나옴

sudo -k # invalidate the user's cached credentials 비번 다시 쳐야함

sudo -s # runs a shell with root privileges

sudo -i # runs a shell with user privileges in root environment

exit
```

## 03_10 - Modify file permissions

chmod 754 test.sh  # owner rwx, group r-x, others r--
```

## 03_11 - Create hard and symbolic links

```

# make symbolic links instead of hard links -s 옵션
ln -s poems.txt writing.txt 
ls -l
> -rwxrwxrwx 2 nueees nueees   1529 Jul 16 15:59 poems.txt
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 nueees nueees      9 Jul 17 15:22 writing.txt -> poems.txt


# hard links
ln poems.txt words.txt
ls -l
> -rwxrwxrwx 2 nueees nueees   1529 Jul 16 15:59 poems.txt
  -rwxrwxrwx 2 nueees nueees   1529 Jul 16 15:59 words.txt

```


## 04_02 - Use pipes to connect commands together

```

# wordcount
echo "Hello" | wc  # 1 line, 1 word, 6 characters
>       1       1       6


echo "Hello world from the command line" | wc # 1 line, 6 word, 36 characters
>       1       6      34

```


## 04_03 - View text files with cat, head, tail, and less

```

# poems.txt에서, -n 라인 옵션준 결과로, 마지막 5줄만
cat poems.txt | cat -n | tail -n5 
>   51
    52  Tyger Tyger burning bright,
    53  In the forests of the night:
    54  What immortal hand or eye,
    55  Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

# poems.txt에서, 마지막 5줄 가져와서, -n 라인 표시
cat poems.txt | tail -n5 | cat -n
>    1
     2  Tyger Tyger burning bright,
     3  In the forests of the night:
     4  What immortal hand or eye,
     5  Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

# 화면에 맞춰서 navigating
less poems.txt

```



## 04_04 - Search for text in files and streams with grep

```
grep "the" poems.txt
> Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,

# 라인 출력 옵션 -n
grep -n "the" poems.txt 
> 7:Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,

# case insensitive 옵션 -i
grep -in "The" poems.txt
> The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.

# ignore 옵션 "the"빼고 출력
grep -vi "the" poems.txt


# regx로 필터할 때
grep -E "[hijk]" poems.txt
> Percy Shelley
  Ozymandias
  I met a traveller from an antique land
  Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,

# word 6 이상인거
grep -E "\w{6,}" poems.txt
> Percy Shelley
  Ozymandias
  I met a traveller from an antique land
  Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,

```
